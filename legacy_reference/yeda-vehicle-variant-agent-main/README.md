# Yeda Vehicle Variant Agent

Default enrichment uses **Gemini Pro only** (`GEMINI_MODEL_STRONG=gemini-3-pro-preview`) for one-time/periodic Israeli variants data building.

- Persistent outputs are saved as JSON files and should be reused by Yeda Rechev later.
- Gemini responses must be compact JSON only (no prose/markdown).
- Mock mode is testing-only.
- Keep cache enabled to avoid paying twice.
- Start with one model, then run small batches.

## Secrets
- `GEMINI_API_KEY="..."`
- `GEMINI_MODEL_STRONG="gemini-3-pro-preview"`
- `GEMINI_MODEL_FAST="gemini-3-flash-preview"`

## Batch Runner Resume Pipeline

- Batch Runner uses deterministic alphabetical ordering by make/model/year.
- Resume is persisted in `data/output/batch_state.json`.
- Use **Run next batch** to continue from last completed seed.
- No run-all button by design.
- If state is lost, use **Rebuild progress from output files**.

## Export

- Final export v2 (`combined_vehicle_variants_final_clean.json`) is the safe file for Yeda Rechev.
- Raw/batch/debug outputs are not production-safe by themselves.
- Mock-contaminated records are automatically removed during clean export build.
- Verified/partial statuses are rebuilt from field evidence and source coverage.
- Trim-only duplicates are merged into technical variants with `trim_options`.
- Final export includes a quality gate (score/grade/blocking issues).
- Use only a passing clean final export in production.
- Latest batch result export contains only last batch summary and results.


## Coverage Audit + Resume Import
- Batch runs in canonical alphabetical order (make/model/year).
- Resume state is persistent in `data/output/batch_state.json`.
- Before moving forward, each batch audits coverage from first seed through last completed seed.
- If holes exist, the next batch repairs holes first and does not continue forward in the same click.
- You can upload `resume_package.json`, `batch_state.json`, `latest_batch_result.json`, `combined_vehicle_variants_final.json`, or `run_history.json` in **Batch Runner > Resume from file**.
- Use **Export > Download resume_package.json** after important progress checkpoints.
- No run-all button by design.
